# Builder Design Pattern

* Implements the Builder Design Pattern for creating a User object.
* Allows setting required fields (username and email) with validation before building.
* Supports optional fields (age, email, address) that can be added or skipped.
* Provides a fluent interface allowing method chaining for easy and readable user construction.
* Ensures that the User object is only created once all required data is set, preventing incomplete objects.
* Includes a simple display() method to output the userâ€™s details for verification.
